# Memory Test

This project implements a basic MicroBlaze system with DDR3 MIG interface running at 400MHz to verify the PCB's layout. Vitis memory tests example is used.

The MicroBlaze processor is clocked at 100MHz which is generated by the MIG. An external 50MHz oscillator from bank 14 is fed into a clocking wizard to generate 200MHz for `ref_clk` and 400MHz for `sys_clk`.
